    Ever had a friend or relative who misspells your name, forgotten how to spell <em>playwright</em>, or confused Timothy 
    <em>Olyphant</em> with Timothy <em>Elephant</em>? Let's write a program that helps us correct these misspelled words.
    You'll be given a word bank of names and a misspelled name.  Use your coding skills to find the correctly spelled name.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a word box of names and a possibly misspelled name.  Find the closest name if any.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A word box of possible names separated by spaces (unicode).
                             The misspelled name as a string (unicode, without spaces).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The closest name if any is close, otherwise the empty string "".
</p>


<div class="for_info_only">

    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
checkio("Arthur Lancelot Robin Bedevere Galahad","Lance-a-lot") == "Lancelot"
checkio("Arthur Lancelot Robin Bedevere Galahad","Lionel") == ""
    </pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a simple exercise in working with strings and using the Python standard library to
    solve common problems without considering the details.  This could be used in trivia programs
    to determine the intended user response while allowing for misspellings.
</p>

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    0 &lt; len(name) &le; 1000
    0 &lt; len(word_box) &le; 1000<br>
    all(ch in string.ascii_letters+'-' for ch in name)
    all(ch in string.ascii_letters+'- ' for ch in word_box)
</p>
